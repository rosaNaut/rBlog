    <p>
I am a researcher and an enthusiast for R programming and 3D-printing.
<br>
My current field of research is the development of smart textiles for medical applications, where our group is developing sensors to help rehabilitate people with severe motion control. Furthermore, I also work with the synthesis of photosensitive bio resins for 3D-printing and their functionalization (to be conductive, flame retardant, elastic, antibacterial, and so on). I hope that my work could someday help create a more sustainable world.
