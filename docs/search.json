My research interests includes (bio)polymers, additive manufacturing, renewable materials and smart materials. Moreover, I am well-versed in sustainability analysis, biomimicry design, materials synthesis, characterization techniques, statistical data analysis, and process optimization.\n\n\nCurrently, I am working in the development of smart materials and textiles for medical applications using 3D-printing. These new materials are going to be used for helping patients to recover part of their lost mobility. Learn more about my research in publications.\n\n\nYou can also get in touch by sending me a message."

Furthermore, I also work with the synthesis of photosensitive bio resins for 3D-printing and their functionalization (to be conductive, flame retardant, elastic, antibacterial, and so on).
