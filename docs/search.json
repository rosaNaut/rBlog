My research interests includes (bio)polymers, additive manufacturing, renewable materials and smart materials. Moreover, I am well-versed in sustainability analysis, biomimicry design, materials synthesis, characterization techniques, statistical data analysis, and process optimization.\n\n\nCurrently, I am working in the development of smart materials and textiles for medical applications using 3D-printing. These new materials are going to be used for helping patients to recover part of their lost mobility. Learn more about my research in publications.\n\n\nYou can also get in touch by sending me a message."

    "text": "About me\n\n  \n    \n    Chemical engineer who likes (bio)plastics and renewable materials. Secretly passionate about astronomy, international politics, sociology and analyzing data.     \n    I enjoy using R to analyze my results and optimize my experiments. Due to the constant usage of R, I started applying it to other things that I think are interesting, such as how climate change will affect cities and some cooking recepies. \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    In the Lab, I am responsible for mentoring the PhD students, writing laboratory guidelines, instrumentation calibration and training, help manager the laboratory resources, developing and updating the laboratory blog and helping to find new PhD candidates. \n    \n    I was trained to perform several types of laboratorial analysis. To help me learn how to operate all these equipments I have created various guidelines, and you can check them out by cliking here or going to the guides section. \n    \n    Finally, you can check all my qualifications by visiting my linkedin page, or by cliking here."
